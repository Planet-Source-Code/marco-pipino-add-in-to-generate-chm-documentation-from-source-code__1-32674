'Project: Documentation Generator
'This Add-in for Visual Basic 6.0 generate a documentation in CHM format
'   directly from code comments.<BR>
'   It's possible to generate a technical documentation for ActiveX components
'   or a complete developer documentation, for the management of Visual Basic
'   projects.<BR>
'   This Full <I>Auto-Documentation</I> shows how to generate a correct documentation.<BR>
'   In order to create the CHM files is needed the HTML HELP Compliler.<BR>
'   The HELP HTML WorkShop with the hhc.exe file included is freeware and
'   avaible (4.00 MB) at Microsoft site<BR>
'   <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp">
'   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp</A><BR>
'   Other requirements are:<BR>
'   Microsoft Office in order to add a menu to Visual Basic IDE
'   (Automatically called from the Add-In Wizard Creation of Visual Basic.
'   If you don't have MSOffice you must create an add-in and serach for code
'   where the add-in insert the menu item)<BR>
'   <BR><BR><IMG src="ScreenShoot1.jpg"><BR><BR>
'   You can personalize the Tags comment, choose the modules you want insert into
'   documentation.<BR>
'   If you want create a technical documentation you must check
'   <B>Public member only</B><BR>
'   Clearly, you can't show the private member or source code.<BR>
'   The check <B>Variables as Property</B> show all variable like property.
'   This only it's necessary in techical documentation but not in
'   developer decomentation.<BR>
'   In order to use this add-in you <B>must</B> save the current project
'   and select the CHM compiler (hhc.exe file).<BR>
'   All changes you made are registered in the registry and saved for next use!<BR>
'   I parse all declaration and nearly all case  but ...  nothing is perfect,
'   I don't have parsed the ParamArray <BR>
'   In order to write the project documentation you must write the Project Tag
'   in the first line of a whichever module. After you can write the documentation
'   for the module after another Project Tag and the next line with the Purpose Tag.
'   (see the Global variables module for a valid example) <BR>
'   In order to write the module documentation you must write the Purpose Tag
'   in the first line of module.<BR>
'   When you write a comment for a member it's important that have no blank
'   line between the last comment and the declaration.<BR>
'   For comment variables, const, UDTs member and Enum member you can write it
'   after the declaration on the same line using also the next line of code
'   with no Tag.<BR>
'   <B>IMPORTANT:</B> This application don't recognize multiple
'   declaration on the same code line.<BR>
'   <B>YOU CAN ADD EVERY HTML TAG TO YOUR COMMENTS FOR A BETTER VISUALIZATION</B><BR>
'   There are a little of comments 'cause I'm Italian and I don't speak currently the
'   english language :-( <BR><BR>
'   Please send me your feedback and report the bugs that you encounter.<BR><BR>
